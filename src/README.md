# Structure of the code

To ensure efficient research on best methods of preprocessing and best models we will use the following structure :

```
finetuning    # testing different preprocessing and models and finetuning their hyperparameters

src
|-- pipeline    # different pipelines definitions
|-- preprocessing    # different preprocessing functions
```
